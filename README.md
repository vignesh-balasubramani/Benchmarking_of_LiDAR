# Solid-State LiDAR Benchmarking for Road Traffic Scenarios

This repository contains MATLAB scripts designed to benchmark solid-state LiDAR performance across a variety of real-world road scenarios. The goal of this project is to evaluate how well different LiDAR configurations perform in diverse environments to support applications in autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## Project Overview

Solid-state LiDARs are compact, reliable, and cost-effective sensors suitable for automotive applications. Understanding how they perform in different road layouts and traffic conditions is essential for selecting the right sensor configuration for safety-critical systems.

### Key Road Scenarios

Each scenario is simulated in MATLAB and includes specific challenges to test the LiDAR's ability to detect and classify objects.

---

#### Highway Intersection

Simulates merging lanes and fast-moving traffic.  
Tests long-range object detection and lane-level accuracy.

---

#### Rural Roads

Represents narrow roads, sharp turns, and slower traffic.  
Evaluates detection in cluttered and low-reflectivity environments.

#### Cross-Section Intersection

Models urban intersections with crossing traffic.  
Analyzes performance in wide fields-of-view and occlusion handling.
